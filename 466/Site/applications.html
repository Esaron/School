        Below are images of three different camera views for a single scene using the fixed pipeline functionality from a program written using the API developed for the project.  Each of these scenes was loaded upon initialization, although they could be lazily loaded on demand if the implementer so desired.  All of the scenes and cameras were swapped out on the fly, and the state for each was saved so that when a particular scene's camera was reloaded, the view was restored.
