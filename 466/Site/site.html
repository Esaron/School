       OpenGL can be a complex and difficult-to-understand framework for implementing code that deals with graphics.  The graphics pipeline, although intuitive after much use, can seem insurmountable to the uninitiated.  The goal of this project was to create a more intuitive and easy-to-use API layered on top of OpenGL that abstracts out the more difficult parts of OpenGL itself, while giving me an opportunity to craft a well-designed framework with custom implementations of the concepts covered in class.

        The focus of this project is creating an extensible basis for a framework that can be easily added on to.  There are several concepts tied together in one cohesive whole.  The first of which is the streamlining and unifying of the different coordinate frames in the graphics pipeline.  The second is the implementation of a concrete camera class, each instance of which has a defined state that can be recovered at any given time and can be used in conjunction with any number of other cameras in the scene.  Tangentially, each camera instance can have custom clipping boundaries and can have its projection mode toggled between orthographic and perspective.  The third is the ability to configure scenes such that they can be swapped out for any number of other scenes on the fly.  A fourth task that I was not able to complete was to allow for quick and easy configuration and swapping of illumination, shading, and texturing of objects in the scene.
